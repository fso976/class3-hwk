It is highly recommended to use singularity in conjunction with High-performance computing (HPC) namely supercomputer. Anyone can run singularity containers without root and it's safe to run without screening its content. The build-in framework takes care of all the security issues. Thus it's highly portable and lightweight without having to run on layers like it does in Docker.
